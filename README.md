<h3 color="green">üôè Acknowledgments</h3>

In building Movix-App, we want to extend our thanks to the following tools and resources that played a huge role in making our app awesome:

- **React (`react`) and React DOM (`react-dom`):** These are the main engines behind our app's dynamic interface and component rendering.

- **React Circular Progressbar (`react-circular-progressbar`):** This cool feature adds visually appealing circular progress bars to Movix.

- **React Icons (`react-icons`):** It's a collection of icons that jazz up our interface and make it more engaging.

- **React Infinite Scroll Component (`react-infinite-scroll-component`):** This makes scrolling through content seamless and intuitive.

- **React Lazy Load Image Component (`react-lazy-load-image-component`):** It helps our app load images more efficiently, making everything faster.

- **React Player (`react-player`):** With this, we smoothly integrate media players for showcasing trailers and videos.

- **React Redux (`react-redux`):** It's what we use to manage our app's state, making everything predictable.

- **React Router DOM (`react-router-dom`):** This makes navigating through our app super smooth and easy.

- **React Select (`react-select`):** It's what powers our dropdown menus, making search functionalities better.

- **Redux Toolkit (`@reduxjs/toolkit`):** This toolset makes managing app state with Redux a breeze, saving us from writing a ton of code.

- **Axios (`axios`):** It's a reliable tool for fetching data from the TMDB API, ensuring our app runs smoothly.

- **Day.js (`dayjs`):** This library helps us with date and time formatting, making things look neat.

- **Sass (`sass`):** It's what we use to style our app, making it look sleek and stylish.
